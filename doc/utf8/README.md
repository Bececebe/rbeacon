# Description

The rbeacon module implements a peer-to-peer discovery service for local
networks. A beacon can broadcast and/or capture service announcements using UDP
messages on the local area network. This implementation uses IPv4 UDP
broadcasts. You can define the format of your outgoing beacons, and set a filter
that validates incoming beacons. Beacons are sent and received asynchronously in
the background.
Note: the current implementation is heavily inspired on
[zbeacon](http://czmq.zeromq.org/manual:zbeacon) from zeromq.
